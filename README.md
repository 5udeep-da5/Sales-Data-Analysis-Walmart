# Sales-Data-Analysis-Walmart
Introduction: Walmart, a global retail juggernaut with 10,586 stores in 24 countries, reigns supreme as the world's largest company by revenue. In February 2023, it reported a staggering $611.3 billion in total revenue for FY2023, solidifying its economic dominance. Yet, beyond its financial might, Walmart boasts the distinction of being the largest private employer worldwide, with a workforce of 2.2 million. This project targets to analyze the sales data of Walmart.

Objective: The sales team wants to know the performance of 3 of our Branches that were recently opened and have been operational for the last 3 months. The sales team has provided us with the sales data for the last 3 months. As a sales analyst, we are expected to analyze the data and generate actionable insights to help the sales team make informed decisions and improve sales. We will be using Python programming language for visualization and conducting univariate and multivariate analysis to draw insights based on the graphs.

Findings: The analysis reveals nuanced customer trends, branch performance variations, and payment preferences in the retail sector. Branch A excels in transaction volumes, while Branch C's larger, less frequent purchases lead to higher total sales. Females wield greater purchasing power, especially evident in the Health & Beauty Products category dominated by male shoppers. Loyalty programs show potential for growth, with non-members contributing significantly to sales. E-wallet emerges as the preferred payment mode, varying across cities. Customer satisfaction is high in Yangon City and Naypyitaw City but lower in Mandalay City, with females consistently awarding higher ratings than males. Sales peak in January, decline in February, and reach their lowest in March, suggesting opportunities for targeted promotions. Weekends see heightened sales, while Mondays witness lower volumes. Afternoon hours, particularly from 12 PM to 4 PM, witness the highest sales, with increased female shopper activity. These insights underscore the importance of tailoring strategies to meet diverse customer preferences and behaviors, optimizing resource allocation, and fostering long-term customer relationships for sustained business growth in the retail sector.
